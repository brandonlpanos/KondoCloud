# The Kondo Screening Cloud

With the help of my Masters supervisor Prof Izak Snyman, I derived analytic and numeric solutions to the Kondo problem under a restricted setting. The Kondo model describes a point-like interaction between the spin degrees of freedom of a local magnetic moment and an electron gas, and the Kondo effect is the suprizing increase in resistivity in some dilute magnetic aloys with a decrease of tempreture. If the impurities in the metal are dilute then one can ignore inter-impurity effects and study the Anderson model.


the interaction withKondo effect is represented by a resistivity minimum when decreasing the tempreture. Meaning that instead of the resistivity continuly decreasing to some finite value as expected, in some

Here, $d^\dagger_\sigma$ and  are the creation and annihilation operators of the impurity orbital. The first term describes the energy contribution of the conduction band electrons, whilst the next two terms describe the energy of the magnetic impurity orbital and the Coulomb penalty in the case of
